## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed raw stock price data  
- 📊 Performed exploratory data analysis with **15+ charts** (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate)  
- 🔍 Conducted **feature engineering** and selection for improving model accuracy  
- 🤖 Trained and evaluated multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- 🔁 Applied **hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)**  
- 💾 Saved the best model as `.pkl` for deployment  
- 🧪 Verified predictions on unseen test data
