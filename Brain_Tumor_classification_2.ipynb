        "### 📌 Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early diagnosis for effective treatment. Radiologists typically rely on MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans for tumor detection and classification. However, manual analysis can be time-consuming, prone to human error, and resource-intensive—especially in remote areas or during a healthcare surge. This project presents a deep learning-based solution to **automate the classification of brain MRI images** into distinct tumor types using both a **custom-built CNN** and **transfer learning** approaches. The final solution is deployed as a **Streamlit web application** to allow seamless real-time predictions for medical professionals and researchers.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary aim is to build a robust, accurate, and scalable machine learning pipeline that can:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Classify brain MRI images into predefined categories: **Glioma Tumor**, **Meningioma Tumor**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**.\n",
        "* Leverage both **custom convolutional neural networks** and **pretrained transfer learning models**.\n",
        "* Provide an interactive and accessible **Streamlit interface** for end-users to upload images and receive instant classification results.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧾 Dataset Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used is the **Brain Tumor MRI Multi-Class Dataset**, which contains thousands of labeled MRI images categorized into four classes. The images differ in quality, brightness, orientation, and resolution, which introduces real-world variability. Thus, preprocessing and augmentation become essential steps in the pipeline.\n",

        "#### 1. **Data Understanding**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Explored sample images from each class.\n",
        "* Analyzed the class distribution to detect any **class imbalance**.\n",
        "* Identified inconsistencies in image resolution and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Resized all images to a standard input shape (e.g., **224×224 pixels**).\n",
        "* Normalized pixel values to the 0–1 range.\n",
        "* Applied **data augmentation** (rotation, flip, zoom, brightness shift) to enhance generalization and combat overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Model Building**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Custom CNN**: Designed from scratch with convolutional layers, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers to minimize overfitting.\n",
        "* **Transfer Learning**: Used pretrained models like **ResNet50**, **EfficientNetB0**, and **MobileNetV2**, replacing top layers to adapt them to the four tumor classes.\n",
        "* Used `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and validation monitoring during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Model Evaluation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Evaluated model performance on unseen test data using:\n",

        "  * **Accuracy**\n",
        "  * **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**\n",

        "* Visualized training history (accuracy/loss curves) to detect overfitting or underfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Model Comparison**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The pretrained models outperformed the custom CNN in terms of accuracy and training speed.\n",
        "* **EfficientNetB0** was selected as the final model due to its **high accuracy, smaller size**, and **fast inference speed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Deployment with Streamlit**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Built a responsive **Streamlit web app** where users can upload MRI images.\n",
        "* Displays the predicted tumor class and model confidence.\n",
        "* The UI is simple, intuitive, and accessible to non-technical users (e.g., medical practitioners).\n",
